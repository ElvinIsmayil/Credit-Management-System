## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core MVC:** For a robust, high-performance web application framework.  
- **ASP.NET Core Identity:** Provides secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.  
- **Entity Framework Core:** Simplifies data access and management.  
- **SQL Server (or your choice of RDBMS):** Manages reliable data persistence for credit and user data.
- **Dependency Injection & Clean Architecture:** Ensures the application is maintainable, scalable, and testable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6.0 SDK (or later)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- A SQL Server instance or another database supported by Entity Framework Core
- An SMTP service for email verification and password reset functionalities

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ElvinIsmayil/Credit-Management-System.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Credit-Management-System
   ```

3. **Restore dependencies:**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

### Configuration

- **Database:** Update your connection string in `appsettings.json` to point to your SQL Server (or alternative database).
- **SMTP Settings:** Configure your SMTP credentials in `appsettings.json` to enable email verification and password reset emails.
- **Environment Variables:** Optionally, set environment-specific variables to securely manage secrets and configurations.

### Running the Application

After configuring the settings, build and run the application:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (or your configured port) to see the application in action.

## Authentication & Admin Workflow

This system employs secure authentication workflows to ensure user data and operations remain safe. The notable points include:

- **User Registration & Login:** Implementing ASP.NET Core Identity for secure login and registration.
- **Email Verification:** New users are required to verify their email address post-registration.
- **Password Management:** Includes facilities for password resets and secure storage practices.
- **Role-Based Routing:** Admins have access to dedicated sections for credit management operations with additional security checks such as lockout policies.
  
This comprehensive approach ensures that your credit management operations maintain a high level of security while offering a smooth user experience.
